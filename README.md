1.  Given historical data, your assignment is to build a predictive model to predict Straddle Open, High, Low, Close data for the next day. I.e. Today is Modnay (11-03-2024) and NIFTY expiry is on Thursday(14-03-2024). Tuesday(12-03-2024) being 2dte, we want to predict Open, High, Low, Close of Straddle prices (Not the index).

2.  Given index pairs SENSEX, NIFTY(NIFTY50), or FINNIFTY, BANKEX have similar constituents to some extent and hence movement is highly correlated, often during sudden movements insurance premiums (straddle prices) tend to spike to different extend, creating opportunities to take advantage as they stabilize. I.e. Check the image below. Your assignment is to 
Find a correlation between pairs 
Create a model or method to quantify spike differentials
